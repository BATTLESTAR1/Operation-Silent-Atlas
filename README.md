Operation Silent Atlas: Mission Dossier

 MISSION OVERVIEW:
 
 Operation Silent Atlas was a tactical simulation project focused on analyzing potential threats in
 Northern Sinai through a self-built Python dashboard. This initiative mimicked real-world defense
 intelligence workflows and provided training in tactical awareness, OSINT feed analysis, and
 geospatial visualization.

 OBJECTIVE:
 
 To investigate unusual military surveillance activity in the Sinai Peninsula, simulate protective
 intelligence operations, and develop a functional threat analysis tool.
 TECH USED:- Python- Folium (map rendering)- Streamlit (UI dashboard)- Mock OSINT Feeds & Threat Pins
 MISSION SUCCESS:- Created a real-time threat dashboard- Automated feed injection and pin geolocation- Integrated fallback logic for failed geolocation- Operational readiness confirmed
 
 IMPACT:
 
 This mission served as a foundation for advanced intelligence simulations, expanding the user's
 tactical and analytical capabilities.
